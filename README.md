Welcome to my repository containing my solutions to challenges from Frontend Mentor! This repository showcases my frontend development skills and demonstrates my ability to create beautiful and responsive web designs.

## About Frontend Mentor

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) is a platform that provides real-world coding challenges for frontend developers. These challenges cover a wide range of skills and are designed to improve your coding abilities. Each challenge comes with a detailed design and a set of user stories to implement.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into different directories, each representing a specific challenge from Frontend Mentor. Within each challenge directory, you will find the following files:

- **index.html**: The HTML file that represents the structure of the web page.
- **style.css**: The CSS file containing the styles for the web page.
- **script.js**: The JavaScript file containing any interactive functionality for the web page.
- **images/**: A directory containing any necessary image assets for the challenge.
- **README.md**: A README file specific to the challenge, providing details, instructions, and any additional notes.

## How to Use

To explore and run the solutions, you can simply navigate to the specific challenge directory of interest. Within each challenge directory, open the `index.html` file in your web browser, and you will see the implemented design. You can interact with the web page as per the provided user stories.
